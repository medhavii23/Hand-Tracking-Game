# Hand-Tracking-Game
Game On, Hands Up! A Game Powered by AI and Computer Vision! 

I'm thrilled to share a project I've worked on—a fun and interactive hand-tracking game using MediaPipe, OpenCV, and some good old Python! 

Here’s how it works:

Objective: Hit as many moving targets as possible in one minute using just your index finger.

Tech: The game uses AI-driven hand tracking to detect your palm and finger movements, dynamically updating targets and keeping score.

Challenge: It starts only when you show your palm, and the rest is pure hand-eye coordination fun!

Tech Highlights:

MediaPipe for real-time hand detection and skeleton mapping.

OpenCV to handle the webcam feed and render the game interface.

Real-time calculations for target detection and scoring.
